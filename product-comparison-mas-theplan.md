As a consumer, I would like to compare product features and options from many brands or companies so that I can make an informed decision.
I want to design a Multi-Agent System (MAS) with CrewAI. Please describe a 4-agent MAS and state each agentâ€™s roles, responsibilities, tasks, and output deliverables for the above purpose and output as a markdown format artifact. 
Analyst: Gathers and analyzes requirements; defines the problem.
Researcher: Collects relevant information and data.
Summary: Synthesizes findings into a concise format.
Reporting: Presents findings and evaluates with recommendations.
